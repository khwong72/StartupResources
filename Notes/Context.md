# Web Development Project Context

## Project Overview
We're building custom websites for clients using a modern development stack (Replit → GitHub → Vercel), but need to provide clients with a no-code editing solution after handoff. Our business model includes a $500 initial build fee, after which clients should be able to make basic edits themselves.

## Technical Stack
- **Development**: Building in Replit
- **Version Control**: Pushing to GitHub
- **Deployment**: Hosting on Vercel
- **Client Editing**: Integrating with Builder.io

## The Challenge
Our clients:
- Are non-technical
- Are familiar with Squarespace-like visual editors
- Need to make content changes without developer assistance
- Should not need to understand code
- May need to manage blog content regularly

We (developers):
- Want to maintain control of the codebase architecture
- Need a clean separation between code and content
- Want to avoid rebuilding sites from scratch in a closed platform
- Need to provide a professional handoff experience

## The Solution: Builder.io Integration
Builder.io provides a bridge between our developer workflow and client editing needs:

1. **Developer Process**:
   - Build the site in Replit using modern frameworks (React, Next.js, etc.)
   - Push to GitHub for version control
   - Deploy on Vercel for hosting

2. **Builder.io Integration**:
   - Connect Builder.io to the GitHub repository using the "Connect a repo" feature
   - Designate editable components/sections
   - Set up content models (including blog post structure)

3. **Client Experience**:
   - Login to Builder.io's visual editor interface
   - Make content changes without touching code
   - Manage blog posts through a familiar CMS interface
   - See changes immediately without developer intervention

## Blog Functionality
For blog sections specifically:
- Create a "Blog Post" content model in Builder.io
- Define fields (title, content, images, metadata, etc.)
- Developer builds the blog template structure
- Client creates/edits posts through Builder's interface
- Content is served via Builder's API to the Vercel-hosted site

## Business Objectives
- Provide clients with independence after initial build
- Reduce ongoing maintenance costs for clients
- Maintain technical quality and performance
- Create clear boundaries between developer and client responsibilities
- Scale our agency business efficiently

This approach gives us the best of both worlds: full developer control over the codebase and architecture while providing clients with a familiar, no-code editing experience for content.
