What legal basis do we have for using your information?

For prospective candidates, contractors, referees and clients, our processing is necessary for our legitimate interests - we need this information in order to be able to assess suitability for potential roles, to find potential candidates and to contact clients and referees, and suppliers.
We carry out a ‘balancing test’ to ensure that our processing is necessary and that your fundamental rights of privacy are not outweighed by our legitimate interests, before we go ahead with such processing. We keep a record of these balancing tests. You have a right to and can find out more about the information in these balancing tests by contacting us using the details below.
If you are interviewed and submitted as a candidate, then this may involve the processing of more detailed personal data including sensitive data such as health information that you or others provide about you. In that case we always ask for your consent before undertaking such processing.
Where we need consent for some activities such as contacting candidates about other recruitment-related services we will ask for it. We rely on soft opt-in consent for these activities where you have previously engaged with us by submitting a CV, applying for a job, or registering on our website. This means we take you consent as given unless or until you opt-out. For other types of e-marketing we require your explicit consent.
What happens if you do not provide us with the information we request or ask that we stop processing your information?

If you do not provide the personal data necessary, or withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data, we may not be able to match you with available job opportunities.
Do we make automated decisions concerning you?

We may make automated decisions about you during the assessment stage of the recruitment process. We put assessment candidates through a structured screening process to assess whether each candidate meets the specific criteria for a particular position. These assessments may be fully automated e.g. online pre-screening tests. As these assessments may result in a candidate being deemed not suitable for a position by means of a solely automated assessment, we only undertake this activity with the candidate’s explicit consent. We also carry out personality profiling on candidates with the candidate’s consent.
Do we use Cookies to collect personal data on you?

To provide better service to you on our websites, we use cookies to collect your personal data when you browse. See our cookie policy for more details.
Do we transfer your data outside the EEA?

No, we do not transfer personal data out of the EEA.
How do we safeguard your personal data?

We take the security of your data very seriously and have put in place appropriate measures that are designed to prevent unauthorised access to or misuse of your personal data.
What rights do you have in relation to the data we hold on you?

By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country.
