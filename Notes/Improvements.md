Here's my feedback on the website so far (happy to share more content if needed): . Stronger Hero Section (Homepage top section)
I’d like to update the headline to be a bit more emotionally engaging and urgent.
Please change it to:
"Scale Faster, Smarter, Without Hiring Headaches"✅
 Strategic hiring support for startup founders and VC portfolios — faster time-to-hire, lower burn, stronger cultural fit.
Keep the “Work With Us” button, but let's add two clearer CTAs later down the page (see point 2). ✅

2. Split CTAs for Founders and VCs ✅
I’d like to add two clear CTA options further down the homepage:
"Founder? Let's Talk Hiring."
"Investor? Let's Protect Your Portfolio."
It’s important to make it obvious that we work with both groups.

3. Add an “Impact” or “Wins” Section
Please create a section highlighting a few key stats to build trust fast.
Example wins to include:
3x faster hiring for Series A+B companies
£450k saved compared to traditional agency fees
95%+ candidate retention after 6 months
Hired across 20+ countries

4. Services Section – Visual Layout
The services text is good but a bit heavy right now.
Could we format it with icons + headlines + short one-liners underneath?
Service categories:
Talent Strategy
Full-Cycle Hiring
Workforce Planning
Embedded Support

5. Testimonials Section – Slight Boost ✅
I’d like slightly stronger or more direct testimonial quotes if possible.
Even anonymised short quotes would be fine, just so they feel more punchy.

6. (Optional) Add a Small Footer Lead Capture Form
If possible, a simple form in the footer like:
"Want to hire smarter? Drop your email."
Just something light for people who aren’t ready to book a call straight away.

7. Final Tweaks:
Please double-check page titles and meta descriptions for SEO (especially homepage — something like:
"Startup Recruitment Partner for Founders & VCs | Startup Resources"
If possible, add some very subtle logos or company names we've worked with (can anonymise if needed).
